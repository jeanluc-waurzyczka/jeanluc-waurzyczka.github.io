

Here is a work around to show a 'not public' plugin on your own website.
For the description I used Chrome, but it can also be done in other browsers:

1. Make and test the plugin within ThingSpeak
2. When done click on view, showing the output on screen
3. Right click and choose Inspect
4. click Sources, and click the thingspeak-number
5. Copy the source of it and paste it in a empty html text-file
6. remove the 2 lines (4 and 5)with: window.NREUM||(NREUM={})……

This file can be placed on your website-server.
In your website html file in the iFrame point to this file.

For example:
iframe width="750" height="1000" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" src="thingspeakplugin.html">

With this method you can use your plugin on your website

Disadvantage of this method is, when you make a change within Thingspeak, you have to manually copy this to
your file again

Il faut également enlever les titres etc...
